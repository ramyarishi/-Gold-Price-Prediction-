📌 Project Title:
Gold Price Prediction using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Networks)

📁 Project Description:

This project aims to predict the future price of gold using historical time series data and a deep learning model, specifically LSTM, which is well-suited for sequential data.

🔍 Problem Statement:
Gold prices fluctuate due to various global economic factors. Accurately predicting its price helps in financial forecasting and investment strategies. The goal is to build an LSTM-based model to learn from past trends and predict future gold prices.

📊 Dataset Description:
File Used: gold.csv (loaded in the notebook)

Time Range:

Train Set: Nov 5, 2011 – Jul 27, 2017

Test Set: Jul 28, 2017 – Dec 31, 2018

Target Variable: Gold price

Features Used: Date, closing price, etc. (based on what your dataset contains)

🧠 ML/DL Techniques Used:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network

Scaled data using MinMaxScaler

Converted time series data to supervised format using a sliding window

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn
